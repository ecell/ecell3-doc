=== About ===

This is a toy model of the Hybrid Dynamic/Static Simulation Algorithm ,
to be run on E-Cell Simulation Environment Version 3.

=== Usage ===

When you use Hybrid Dynamic/Static Simulation Algorithm in your model,
you need FluxDistributionStepper, FluxDistributionProcess,
QuasiDynamicFluxProcess correctly.

* FluxDistributionStepper

When you use FluxDistributionStepper,
FluxDistributionStepper does not need to set Properties.

When Influx Process or efflux Process in Dynamic part write
Variables in Static part, FluxDistributionStepper
call Process in Static part.
FluxDistributionStepper do not have StepInterval,
call step() at interupt by Other Stepper, do not call step() by self.


* FluxDistributionProcess

When you use FluxDistributionProcess,
FluxDIstributionProcess need to set follwing Properties.

-StepperID
set FluxDistributuinStepper's ID.
-UnknownProcessList
set a list of Process FullID that QuasiDynamicFluxProcess in Static Part.

-KnownProcessList
set a list of Process FullID that Influx Process
or efflux Process in Dynamic part.

* QuasiDynamicFluxProcess

When you use QuasiDynamicFluxProcess,
QuasiDynamicFluxProcess need to set follwing Properties.

-StepperID
set FluxDistributuinStepper's ID.

-VariableReferenceList
set VariableReferenceList that show Flux Information in Static part.

-Irreversible
set 1, if this Process is Ireeversible. default 0.

=== Running this model ===

1. (If necessary) Convert the .em file to .eml file.

   % ecell3-em2eml Toy_Hybrid.em
   % ls Toy_Hybrid.eml
   Toy_Hybrid.eml

2. Run gecell, File->loadModel and load the Toy_Hybrid.eml file.
