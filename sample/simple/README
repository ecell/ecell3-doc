=== Files and directories ===

README:                    This file
simple.em:                 Model file(em file) for this model
MichaelisUniUniProcess.dm: Process file(dm file) for this model



=== Running this model ===

1. (If necessary) Convert the .em file to .eml file.

   % em2eml simple.em
   % ls simple.eml
   simple.eml


2. Compile .dm files.

   Run emtool -a for each .dm file.

   % emtool -a ...dm

   Or, to do this job at once,

   (at bash prompt,)
   % for i in *.dm ; do emtool -a $i ; done
   

3. Run gecell, File->loadModel and load the simple.eml file.
