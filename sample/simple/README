=== About ===

This is a very simple sample model, 
intended to introduce E-Cell 3 to beginners.
This model consists of only three molecular species(S, P, E),
and one reaction(MichaelisUniUniProcess).



=== Files and directories ===

README:                    This file
simple.em:                 Model file(em file) for this model
simple.eml:                Model file(eml file) for this model
MichaelisUniUniProcess.dm: Process file(dm file) for this model



=== A how-to for running models on E-Cell 3 ===

1) Compile all Process files(dm files) included in the model, by using emtool.
   The emtool program generates a Shared Object file(so file)
   from each corresponding Process file.

   % emtool -a MichaelisUniUniProcess.dm

2) Execute gecell, the gui for E-Cell3.

   % gecell

3) Load Model file(eml file)

   3.1) Click 'File' in Main Window
   3.2) Click 'Load Model' in pulldown menu
   3.3) Select Model file to load(e.g. simple.eml)
   3.4) Click 'Start' in Main Window to start simulation
