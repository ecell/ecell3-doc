This is a very simple example of E-Cell Session Manager Script (ESM)
for SessionManager. SessionManager concurrently runs script files,
including ESS files or other script files(sh,python,etc.).



=== Files and directories ===

README:                     This file
TestProcess.cpp             Process file. It is same as MichaelisUniUniFluxProcess.cpp
onerun.ess:                 Script file for E-Cell session
sample.esm:                 Script file for E-Cell session manager
simple.em:                  Model file(EM file) 


=== Running this script ===

1. Convert the .em file to .eml file.

   % ecell3-em2eml simple.em
   % ls simple.eml
   simple.eml

2. Compile the .cpp file to .so file.

   % ecell3-dmc TestFluxProcess.cpp
   % ls TestFluxProcess.so
   TestFluxProcess.so

3. Run esm file.

   % ecell3-session-manager sample.esm
