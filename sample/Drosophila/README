=== About ===

This is a model of the oscillating Drosophila period protein(PER),
to be run on E-Cell Simulation Environment Version 3.
This model is based on the model introduced in the following publication.

A.Goldbeter, 
"A model for circadian oscillations in the Drosophila period protein(PER)"
Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci, Vol.261:319-324, Sep 1995.

=== A how-to for running models on E-Cell 3 ===

1) Compile all Process files(dm files) included in the model, by using emtool.
   The emtool program generates a Shared Object file(so file)
   from each corresponding Process file.

   % emtool -a MichaelisUniUniProcess.dm

2) Execute gecell, the gui for E-Cell3.

   % gecell

3) Load Model file(eml file)

   3.1) Click 'File' in Main Window
   3.2) Click 'Load Model' in pulldown menu
   3.3) Select Model file to load(e.g. simple.eml)
   3.4) Click 'Start' in Main Window to start simulation
