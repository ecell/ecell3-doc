=== A how-to for running models on E-Cell 3 ===

1) Compile all Process files(dm files) included in the model, by using emtool.
   The emtool program generates a Shared Object file(so file)
   from each corresponding Process file.

   % emtool -a MichaelisUniUniProcess.dm

2) Execute gecell, the gui for E-Cell3.

   % gecell

   3.1) Click 'File' in Main Window
   3.2) Click 'Load Model' in pulldown menu
   3.3) Select Model file to load(e.g. simple.eml)
   3.4) Click 'Start' in Main Window to start simulation
