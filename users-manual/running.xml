  <!-- =========== Getting Started ============================== -->
  <!-- Use the Getting Started section to describe the steps required
  to start the application and to describe the user interface components
  of the application. If there is other information that it is important
  for readers to know before they start using the application, you should
  also include this information here. 
  If the information about how to get started is very short, you can 
  include it in the Introduction and omit this section. -->

    <title>Preparing Simulation</title> 
    
    <para> To start the simulation, you need at least these types of files:
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>A model file in EML format</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
              (optionally but usually) shared object files (.so in
              Linux operating system), if you are using special classes
              of object in the model file which is not provided by the system
              by default.
             </para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

    </para>
    <para>
      If you have them in different formats other than EML and .so, 
      you have to convert your files (such as EM and DM) by procedures
      explained in this section.
    </para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Converting EM to EML</title>
      <para>
        To convert EM (.em) files to EML (.eml) files, type the
        following command.
      </para>
      <para><command>ecell3-em2eml</command> <replaceable>filename.em</replaceable></para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Compiling DM to make .so</title>

      <para>If you have your own DM classes which are not part of the
standard DM library distributed with the package, you have to make
source files compiled before use.</para>

      <para>Use <command>ecell3-dmc</command> command as a DM compiler.</para>

      <para><command>ecell3-dmc</command> <option>[options]</option>
<replaceable>filename.cpp</replaceable> <option>[compiler options]</option></para>

      <para>The arguments given before the file name (<option>[command
      options]</option> are interpreted as options to the
      <command>ecell3-dmc</command> command itself.</para>

      <para>The arguments after the file name are passed to a backend
      compiler (such as g++) as-is.  The backend compiler used is the
      same as the one used to build the system itself.</para>

      <para>To observe what the command actually does inside, enable
      verbose mode by specifying <option>-v</option> option.</para>

      <para>To get a full list of available
      <command>ecell3-dmc</command> options, invoke the command with
      <option>-h</option> option, and without the input file.  Here is
the help message gotten by <command>ecedll3-dmc</command> <option>-h</option>.
