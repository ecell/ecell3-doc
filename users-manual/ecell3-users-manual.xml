    <!-- The revision numbering system for GNOME manuals is as follows: -->
    <!-- * the revision number consists of two components -->
    <!-- * the first component of the revision number reflects the release version of the GNOME desktop. -->
    <!-- * the second component of the revision number is a decimal unit that is incremented with each revision of the manual. -->
    <!-- For example, if the GNOME desktop release is V2.x, the first version of the manual that -->
    <!-- is written in that desktop timeframe is V2.0, the second version of the manual is V2.1, etc. -->
    <!-- When the desktop release version changes to V3.x, the revision number of the manual changes -->
    <!-- to V3.0, and so on. -->

  <!-- =========== Getting Started ============================== -->
  <!-- Use the Getting Started section to describe the steps required
  to start the application and to describe the user interface components
  of the application. If there is other information that it is important
  for readers to know before they start using the application, you should
  also include this information here. 
  If the information about how to get started is very short, you can 
  include it in the Introduction and omit this section. -->

    <title>Preparing Simulation</title> 

    <highlights>
      <para>This chapter explains how to prepare files needed to
       run the simulator.</para>
    </highlights>

    <para> To start the simulation, you need at least a model file in
      EML format, and (optionally but usually) binary shared object
      files (SO or .so) of the object classes appearing in the EML
      file.  
    </para>

    <sect1>
      <title>Converting EM to EML</title>
      <para>
        To convert EM (.em) files to EML (.eml) files, type the
        following command.
      </para>
      <para> 
	<command>em2eml</command> 
	<replaceable>filename.em</replaceable>
      </para> 

    </sect1>

    <sect1>
      <title>Compiling DM to make .so</title>
      <para>
        To make a DM (.dm) file compiled into a SO (.so) file,
        type the following command.
    		</para>
      <para> 
	<command>emtool</command> <option>-a</option>
	<replaceable>filename.dm</replaceable>
      </para> 


      <note>
	<para>When debugging the DM files users may want to check 
	converted C++ source code (.cpp files).  Use <option>-g</option>
	commandline option to command emtool program to stop after generating
        and before compiling and deleting the source code.
      </para> 
	<para> 
	<command>emtool</command> <option>-g</option>
	<replaceable>filename.dm</replaceable>
      </para>
      </note>

      <note>
	<para>Sometimes advanced users may want to create SO files
	directly from C++ source code files (.cpp files).  Use -c
	commandline option to let emtool program interpret the input as
        C++ source code, not DM scipt.
      </para>
